# Box Cluttering Chaos

This game was my entry into the Duck Sauce Game Jam 2022. The theme for the Game Jam was Chaos and I built the game in Godot Engine.

This game is a simple 2D game in which you create chaos by exploding arrangements of boxes to get them as cluttered as possible. Your score increases the further each box is away from its starting point, with bonuses to boost your score more.
